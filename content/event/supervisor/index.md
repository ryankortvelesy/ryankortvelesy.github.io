summary: Supervisor for Clare, Emmanuel, and Selwyn Colleges in Foundations of Computer Science.
abstract: A long-held tenet of Cambridge's teaching philosopy is the supervision. Supervisions are held between a supervisor and one to three students, intended to "deepen their thinking and explore topics further". I supervised for *Foundations in Computer Science*, which is an introductory course that focuses on algorithms, data structures, complexity, and functional programming.
