summary: Engaged kids virtually with interactive AI activities.
abstract: Preparation for a virtual guest lecture aimed at 8-13-year-olds centered on creating an engaging session around Artificial Intelligence (AI). Inspired by email exchanges with the class organizer, the approach aimed to make AI concepts accessible and enjoyable. This involved using relatable examples from daily life to discuss AI applications and facilitating group discussions to explore concepts like Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Students were encouraged to collaboratively create MDP graphs. Additionally, the session included interactive introductions to search algorithms, prompting student participation through questions and discussions.
